# DCX-Blender
A Blender plugin for importing Fromsoft DCX files. Code based heavily from the [SoulsFormats](https://github.com/JKAnderson/SoulsFormats) and [blender-flver](https://github.com/elizagamedev/blender-flver) (Essentially is just a faster way of getting models from the game files directly into Blender). Currently supports DS3 and DS1 file types.
